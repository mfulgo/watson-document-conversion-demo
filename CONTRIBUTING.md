# Questions

If you are having difficulties using the APIs or have a question about
the IBM Watson Services, please ask a question on [dW Answers][dw] or
[Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].

# Issues

For problems with the underlying Java SDK, please see the
[Java SDK project](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk).

If you have an improvement or bug fix you'd like to contribute to this
''demo'', feel free to submit a pull request. If you're looking to
create something fancy or complex, please consider contributing it to
the Java SDK as a new feature instead.

# Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the repository, here's a quick guide:
  1. Fork the repository
  2. Develop your changes.
    * Please keep the code as approachable and readable as possible.
    * Create minimal diffs. If you feel the source code should be
      reformatted create a separate PR.
    * Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before
      committing.
  3. The project is too simple right now to really have tests. So,
     don't worry about that unless you think they're warrented. (I
     can't believe I just said that.)
  4. Commit your changes
  5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
